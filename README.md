# First assignment
The first assignment is simply a software documentation, in Doxygen, of the second one of rt1, which you can find more information on [my previous repository](https://github.com/SimoBor99/Rt1_assignment2). Hence you can find my [documentation](https://simobor99.github.io/Rt2_assignments/).

# Second assignment
This is a jupyter notebbok version of the second assignment of rt1, which the user can set a new goal or delete. 
The menu is made up by widgets and text boxes, while graph and bar chart are used for plotting trajectory of robot, goals and number of reached and deleted goals.

For running it, you shoul click on the button **Run** on jupyter for each cell, otherwise you are not able to set a goal before seeing the plot. Once you have done it, you can set or delete a goal using the menu on the third last cell; the graph and the bar chart will be automaticaly updated.
So this is my [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/SimoBor99/Rt2_assignments/blob/master/Assignment_2_rt2_Borelli_Simone.ipynb).
